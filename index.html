        <h3>What Readers Are Saying</h3>

            “Very impressive family drama!
            Helen devotedly supports her 
            father when he is blamed for rape, 
            and afterward goes to prison. 
            She begins to question all six years 
            later when he is going to get out. 
            She starts to realize that, in her opinion, 
            it might not have happened at that time. 
            This emotional story is really worth reading!”

                "This is a rather good story with its potential. 
                 But I think It should be a bit shortened. 
                 This family drama is relevant today. 
                 I would highly recommend it to those who are 15+ years of age."

                <p3>“Quite thrilling story focused on the truth and faithfulness, 
                    realness and perception. 
                    It covers such important things nowadays as harmony, honor, and modesty, 
                    as well as the nature of shame that needs to be told (again and again). 
                    Bravo to Rebecca Johansen for telling this story and for telling it so well!"
