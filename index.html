            <h3>About the Book</h3>
            <p>In this evocative debut novel, Rebecca Johansen weaves a riveting story of past and present.</p>
            <p>Helen Bryant is twenty-five years old. She feels that her life is on the rise now. She has a great
                job in
                New York City and falls in love with a fascinating artist. Her traumatic memories of the past
                finally
                begin to disappear. Helen's life broke up almost ten years ago, during an idyllic summer in her
                family’s
                house on Eagle Lake, when her very old friend blamed her father for rape. During the detention
                pending
                trial, Helen insisted on her father's innocence. She tried to avoid meeting the reporters and
                clinging
                to the memories about the most adorable man.</p>
            <p>Now her father is getting out. However, when Helen returns to a closed lakeside house, the details of
                that fatal night come up: the freeze of the lake, the first love's heat, the frightening bite of
                jealousy. And as old memories face new realities, they doubt everything she thinks she knows about
                her
                family, friends, and, finally, about herself. Now Helen's choice will be tested with life-changing
                after-effects.</p>

                        “Very impressive family drama!
                        Helen devotedly supports her
                        father when he is blamed for rape,
                        and afterward goes to prison.
                        She begins to question all six years
                        later when he is going to get out.
                        She starts to realize that, in her opinion,
                        it might not have happened at that time.
                        This emotional story is really worth reading!”

                    "This is a rather good story with its potential.
                    But I think It should be a bit shortened.
                    This family drama is relevant today.
                    I would highly recommend it to those who are 15+ years of age."
